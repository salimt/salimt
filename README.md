### .init
Hi, I'm salimt! I've been writing programs quite a bit now. Some 
of my professional background is listed on my LinkedIn.

### .now
I'm currently working on ML-based projects and policy analyses. 

### .code
I use GitHub mostly as a sandbox to play as well as an archive for my old projects 
but I have a couple of hobby open source projects that are slightly more popular.
